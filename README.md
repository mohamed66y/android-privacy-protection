# Android Privacy Protection Project

This project documents my personal journey to improve my privacy and block trackers on my Android phone.

I'm a beginner, and I'm using free, open-source tools that work without root access.

---

## Objectives

- Block hidden trackers in apps
- Stop apps from sending my data without permission
- Analyze which apps are spying on me
- Use open-source tools (no root needed)

---

## Tools I'm Using

### 1. [TrackerControl (GitHub Version)](https://github.com/OxfordHCC/tracker-control-android)

- Detects and blocks trackers in apps
- Shows which companies are tracking you
- Helps control app network traffic

### 2. [NetGuard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard)

- Acts as a firewall (no root)
- Blocks internet access for specific apps
- Controls mobile/Wi-Fi data per app

### 3. [PCAPdroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tech.inaudible.pcapdroid)

- Monitors all network traffic
- Shows where apps are sending your data
- Exports data for deep analysis
