ki# Android Privacy Protection – Oppo A5s (Android 8.1)

This project documents my personal journey to protect my Android phone (Oppo A5s – Android 8.1) from tracking and spying.  
I'm a beginner, and I'm using simple tools and methods to understand and control what's happening on my phone.

---

## Objectives

- Block hidden trackers in apps.
- Stop apps from sending my data to unknown servers.
- Analyze which apps are spying on me.
- Use open-source tools (no root needed).

## Tools I'm Using

### 1. [TrackerControl (GitHub version)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kollnig.missioncontrol.fdroid)
- Detects and blocks trackers inside apps.
- Shows which companies are tracking me.

### 2. [NetGuard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard)
- Acts as a firewall (no root).
- Blocks internet access for specific apps.

### 3. [PCAPdroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.greyshirts.pcapdroid)
- Monitors all network traffic.
- Shows where apps are sending data (with IPs and countries).
